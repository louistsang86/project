Data Science Project Plan

KEY INFORMATION
y-variable: funded (1) or (expired)

Data variations 
- All loan data
- All loan data + country data
- All loan data + country data + partner data 
- All loan data + country data + partner data + text clustering on loan_use variable

*- completed

PLAN
1. Data visualitions to give an overview of the data
overview
*- loan count: by country, by year, by sector

status_bin
*- by country (map)
*- by year
*- by sector
*- by country by year (map)

2. Clean data
*- clear columns that have lots of nas
*- drop rows of variables you want that have nas

3. Logistic Regression
- Run a logistic regression for each vairable-> see which variable is the best predictor
- Understand correlation output-> omit variables that are highly correlated
- Run a logistic regression with all variables-> see which variables are the most important
- Get features from this and use for decision trees

4. Decision Tree
*- Create decision tree
*- Evaluate (accuracy score and ROC)
- Finetuning the tree
- Compare against logistic

5. Random Forest
- create RF
- Evaluate (accuracy score and ROC)
- Finetuning
- Compare against Logistic + Decision tree


Other ideas:
-  Alternative y-variable
    Using funded data: time it took to fund as
    Using expired data: share of loan that was funded
- Recommendation engines for recommending loans to particular lenders 
- Applying clustering analysis to loan data
